## What the bot does
Keeps moving forward till the ultrasonic sensor senses obstacle within collision distance (30 here). It then stops, and the ultrasonic mounted on top of servo motor turns left and right and finds out the direction with most free space and turns and moves in that direction.

## Components Used
* Arduino UNO
* Bot Chasis
* DC Motors x2
* L293D Motor Driver IC
* Wheels
* Breadboard
* HC SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
* Servo Motor
* 9V Battery
* Jumper Wires
* Power supply - Power Bank
